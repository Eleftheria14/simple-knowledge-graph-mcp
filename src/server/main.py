Simple Knowledge Graph MCP Server

A modular FastMCP server that registers tools from separate modules for building
and querying knowledge graphs. This server orchestrates storage and query tools
to provide a complete research assistant interface.

Architecture:
- Storage tools: Entity and text storage in Neo4j (with vector search)
- Query tools: Knowledge graph search and literature review generation  
- Management tools: Database utilities and cleanup operations

The server initializes storage managers and registers all tools from their
respective modules, providing a clean separation of concerns.
