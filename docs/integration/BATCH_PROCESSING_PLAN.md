## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 0: n8n Installation & Exploration (Day 1)
**Goal**: Get familiar with n8n interface and capabilities before building integration

**Installation Options:**
```bash
# Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n

# Option 2: npm global install
npm install n8n -g
n8n start
```

**Exploration Tasks (30 minutes):**
1. **Access Interface**: Open `http://localhost:5678` and create admin account
2. **Build Test Workflow**: 
   - Manual Trigger → HTTP Request → Set (transform data) → Webhook output
3. **Explore Available Nodes**:
   - LLM nodes (OpenAI, Claude, Anthropic)
   - File handling and upload nodes
   - Database connectors (Neo4j, HTTP)
   - Workflow templates
4. **Understand Visual Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface, node connections, data flow

**Benefits**: Hands-on familiarity with n8n before architecting integration

### Phase 1: API Wrapper (Week 1)
```python
# Create FastAPI endpoints wrapping your MCP tools
@app.post("/extract-entities")
@app.post("/store-vectors") 
@app.post("/query-graph")
@app.post("/generate-review")
```

### Phase 2: n8n Workflow (Week 2)
```
[File Upload] → [PDF-to-Text] → [LLM Provider Choice] → [Entity Extraction] → [Store Results]
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                     ↓              ↓
  Web Form    pdfplumber API    Claude/GPT/Gemini    Your FastAPI    Neo4j+ChromaDB
```

### Phase 3: User Interface (Week 3)
- **Upload form** for multiple PDFs
- **Provider selection** (Anthropic/OpenAI/Google)
- **Progress tracking** with real-time updates
- **Results dashboard** showing entities/relationships
- **Export capabilities** for literature reviews

## Secondary Recommendation: Dify for Advanced Users

If you want maximum flexibility and plan to expand beyond knowledge graphs:
- **Dify** offers the most comprehensive LLMOps platform
- **Built-in RAG** and workflow capabilities
- **Plugin marketplace** for extensibility
- **MCP integration** announced for 2025

## Why Not the Others?

**LangGraph**: Overkill for your use case, requires significant Python development
**Flowise/LangFlow**: Good for prototyping but less mature than n8n for production
**AnythingLLM/Open WebUI**: Great for chat interfaces but not designed for batch workflows

## Learning Path Recommendation

1. **Start with n8n** (2-3 weeks to proficiency)
   - Immediate value for your knowledge graph project
   - Transferable skills to other automation needs
   - Large community and extensive documentation

2. **Consider Dify later** if you need advanced LLMOps features
   - More complex but more powerful
   - Better for scaling to enterprise workflows

## Implementation Benefits

- ✅ **No coding required** for workflow changes
- ✅ **Visual debugging** of processing pipelines
- ✅ **Multi-provider cost optimization** 
- ✅ **Researcher-friendly interface**
- ✅ **Production-ready scalability**
- ✅ **Maintains existing architecture**

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: powerful automation capabilities with minimal learning curve, while preserving your excellent existing MCP system for interactive use.
