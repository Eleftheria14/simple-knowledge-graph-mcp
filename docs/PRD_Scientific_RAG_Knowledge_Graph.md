## üéØ Executive Summary

Building an intelligent scientific paper analysis platform that combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with **Knowledge Graph** capabilities to enable researchers to:

## üöÄ Vision Statement

**"Transform how researchers interact with scientific literature by creating an AI-powered platform that understands both the content and connections within scientific papers, enabling intelligent discovery and analysis."**

---

## üé™ Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points:
1. **Manual Paper Analysis**: Researchers spend hours reading papers to extract key information
2. **Lost Context**: Analysis is done in isolation without understanding paper relationships  
3. **Repetitive Processing**: Same papers analyzed multiple times for different questions
4. **Limited Discovery**: Hard to find connections between related work, methods, and results
5. **Knowledge Silos**: No persistent memory of analyzed papers and their relationships

### Target Users:
- **Research Scientists**: Need comprehensive paper analysis and relationship discovery
- **R&D Teams**: Require competitive intelligence and trend analysis
- **Academic Researchers**: Want literature review automation and citation analysis
- **Data Scientists**: Need methodology comparison and performance benchmarking
