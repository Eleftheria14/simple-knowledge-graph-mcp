## **🎯 Product Vision**
**Become the standard open-source platform for creating domain-specific GraphRAG MCP servers.** Enable any professional with specialized knowledge—from lawyers to doctors to engineers—to transform their document collections into intelligent AI assistants that understand their field's unique context, terminology, and relationships.

---

## **📈 Business Context**

### **Problem Statement**
Every professional field has unique knowledge structures, but AI systems treat all domains the same:
- **Generic AI Limitations**: ChatGPT/Claude don't understand specialized terminology, regulatory frameworks, or domain-specific relationships
- **Knowledge Silos**: Professional expertise trapped in documents, not accessible to AI assistants
- **Technical Barriers**: Building domain-specific AI requires ML expertise most professionals lack
- **Expensive Solutions**: Enterprise knowledge graph solutions cost $100K+ and require vendor lock-in
- **Privacy Concerns**: Uploading sensitive professional documents to cloud APIs

### **Market Opportunity**
- **Universal Need**: Every knowledge worker has domain-specific documents (legal briefs, medical guidelines, technical specs, research papers, etc.)
- **MCP Ecosystem**: Growing standard for AI tool integration, but lacks domain-specific implementations
- **Local AI Revolution**: Ollama democratizes powerful AI without cloud dependencies
- **Open Source Preference**: Professionals prefer transparent, auditable AI tools for sensitive work
- **Proven Technology**: Advanced knowledge graph extraction already demonstrated

### **Strategic Vision**
**Position as "the WordPress of GraphRAG"** - make it as easy to create a domain-specific AI assistant as it is to create a website. Transform any professional's document collection into an intelligent, domain-aware AI that understands their field's unique knowledge structures.

## **📚 Detailed User Story: Academic Literature Review**

### **Primary User Story**

**As a PhD student in computational chemistry**, I want to upload 50 papers on "machine learning for drug discovery" and create an intelligent research assistant that understands domain-specific relationships, so I can systematically write citation-accurate literature review sections while discovering hidden connections between research approaches.

### **🎯 Detailed User Journey**

#### **Phase 1: Corpus Building (Weekend Setup)**

**User Context**: Sarah is a 3rd-year PhD student working on her dissertation chapter on ML approaches to molecular property prediction. She has collected 50 key papers but feels overwhelmed by the complexity of synthesizing them into coherent sections.

**Current Pain Points**:
- Papers scattered across different subdisciplines (graph neural networks, transformers, traditional ML)
- Hard to track which papers support which claims
- Missing connections between related approaches
- Citation management is manual and error-prone
- Can't see the "big picture" of how the field has evolved

**GraphRAG MCP Workflow**:

```bash
# Sarah starts her weekend literature review prep
mkdir ~/dissertation/ml_drug_discovery
cd ~/dissertation/ml_drug_discovery

# Install and setup (one-time)
pip install graphrag-mcp-toolkit
graphrag-mcp create literature-assistant --template academic

# Upload her paper collection
graphrag-mcp add-documents ./papers/
# Processing: 50 papers × 8 minutes = ~7 hours (runs overnight)

# Generate MCP server
graphrag-mcp generate-server --domain-config chemistry
graphrag-mcp serve --port 8080
```

#### **Phase 2: Discovery and Exploration (Monday Research)**

**Connection Discovery**
```
Query: "Show me papers that combine graph neural networks with attention mechanisms for molecular property prediction"

GraphRAG Response:
📊 Found 7 papers with this combination:

1. ChemFormer (Chen et al. 2023)
   - Combines GCN backbone with transformer attention
   - Achieves 94% accuracy on solubility prediction
   - Cites: [Paper_ID_12, section 3.2, lines 245-267]
   - Related entities: ["self-attention", "molecular graphs", "SMILES"]

2. MolTran (Kumar et al. 2024)  
   - Graph attention networks for molecular representation
   - Builds on ChemFormer but adds positional encoding
   - Relationship: IMPROVES_ON → ChemFormer

Cross-paper insights:
🔗 Connection: Both papers use PubChem dataset for validation
🔗 Evolution: Kumar explicitly builds on Chen's attention mechanism
🔗 Gap identified: No papers combine GNN+attention for protein-drug interactions
```

**Research Timeline Discovery**
```
Query: "How has the use of transformers in drug discovery evolved from 2020-2024?"

GraphRAG Response:
📈 Evolution Timeline:

2020: Molecular-BERT (Wang et al.)
├── Foundation: Pre-trained on SMILES sequences
├── Impact: 15 citations in corpus
└── Limitation: Fixed-length sequences only

2023: ChemFormer (Chen et al.)
├── Innovation: Combines transformers + graph structure
├── Performance: 94% vs 67% (previous SOTA)
├── Cites: Both Wang and Ahmed as foundation
└── Current influence: 12 citations in corpus

2024: Multi-modal approaches
├── Trend: Text + structure + properties
├── Key players: Kumar, Torres, Liu
└── Next frontier: Protein-molecule interactions
```

#### **Phase 3: Literature Review Writing (Tuesday-Wednesday Writing)**

**Sarah connects Claude Max to her MCP server and begins systematic writing:**

**Sarah's Prompt to Claude Max**:
> "Write a methodology overview section for transformer-based approaches to molecular property prediction. Focus on the evolution from sequence-only to graph-aware methods. Include specific performance numbers and proper citations."

**Claude Max Response** (with real-time MCP queries):
```markdown
## Transformer-Based Approaches to Molecular Property Prediction

The application of transformer architectures to molecular property prediction has evolved significantly from early sequence-based approaches to sophisticated graph-aware methods. Initial work by Wang et al. (2020) established Molecular-BERT as a foundation for pre-training on molecular SMILES sequences, achieving 67% accuracy on standard benchmarks [1]. 

The breakthrough came with Chen et al. (2023), who developed ChemFormer by combining graph convolutional networks with transformer attention mechanisms [3]. This hybrid approach achieved 94% accuracy on molecular solubility prediction tasks, representing a 40% improvement over purely sequence-based methods.

```

#### **Phase 4: Research Gap Identification**

```
Query: "What research gaps exist in transformer approaches to drug discovery?"

GraphRAG Response:
🔍 Identified Research Gaps:

1. Protein-Drug Interaction Modeling
   ├── Current state: Most work focuses on molecular properties only
   ├── Gap: Few papers combine molecular and protein transformers
   ├── Opportunity: Multi-modal protein-molecule attention
   └── Evidence: Only 2/50 papers address this (Torres et al., Liu et al.)

2. Multi-Target Drug Discovery
   ├── Current state: Single-target optimization focus
   ├── Gap: Polypharmacology not addressed by transformers
   ├── Opportunity: Graph transformers for drug-target networks
   └── Evidence: Mentioned as limitation in 8 papers but not addressed

🎯 Recommendation: Gap #1 (protein-drug interactions) has the strongest foundation for novel research based on your corpus.
```
