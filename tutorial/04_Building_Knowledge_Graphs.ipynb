(2019) demonstrated the effectiveness of BERT-style transformers on molecular data.\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for representing molecular structures.\n\nMethods:\nWe developed ChemFormer using the following components:\n1. Molecular graph encoding using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)\n2. Transformer attention layers adapted for chemical structures  \n3. Multi-task learning framework for property prediction\n\nOur model was trained on several key datasets:\n- PubChem: 100M molecular structures\n- ChEMBL: Bioactivity data for 2M compounds\n- QM9: Quantum mechanical properties for 134K molecules\n- ZINC: Drug-like compounds for virtual screening\n\nWe used PyTorch and RDKit for implementation, with training performed on NVIDIA V100 GPUs.\nThe model achieves 94% accuracy on molecular solubility prediction tasks.\n\nExperiments:\nWe evaluated ChemFormer on multiple benchmarks:\n- Molecular property prediction (RMSE: 0.23)\n- Drug-target interaction prediction (AUC: 0.89)\n- Toxicity classification (F1-score: 0.91)\n\nComparison with existing methods shows significant improvements:\n- Outperforms Graph Attention Networks by 12%\n- Exceeds classical fingerprint methods by 35% \n- Matches performance of specialized chemical predictors\n\nResults:\nChemFormer demonstrates superior performance across all evaluated tasks.\nThe attention mechanism successfully identifies key molecular substructures.\nTransfer learning enables rapid adaptation to new chemical domains.\n\nApplications in pharmaceutical research include:\n- Lead compound optimization\n- ADMET property prediction  \n- Virtual compound screening\n- Drug repurposing analysis\n\nConclusions:\nWe have successfully combined transformer architectures with graph neural networks for drug discovery.\nThe ChemFormer model represents a significant advance in computational chemistry.\nFuture work will explore larger scale pretraining and multi-modal molecular representations.\n\nAcknowledgments:\nThis work was supported by NIH grants R01-AI123456 and NSF Award CHE-7890123.\nWe thank Google Cloud Platform for computational resources and the open-source community.\n\"\"\"\n\npaper_title = \"Transformer-Based Drug Discovery using Graph Neural Networks\"\n\nprint(f\"‚úÖ Sample text created successfully!\")\nprint(f\"üì∞ Title: {paper_title}\")\nprint(f\"üìä Content length: {len(paper_content):,} characters\")\nprint(f\"üî¨ Rich with entities: authors, institutions, methods, datasets, technologies!\")\n\n# Add paper to knowledge graph (using basic extraction for speed)\nresult = graph_rag.extract_entities_and_relationships(\n    paper_content=paper_content,\n    paper_title=paper_title,\n    paper_id=\"paper_1\"\n)\n\nprint(f\"\\n‚úÖ Sample paper added to knowledge graph!\")\nprint(f\"üìù Documents created: {result['documents_added']}\")\nprint(f\"üè∑Ô∏è Entities extracted: {sum(len(entities) for entities in result['entities'].values())}\")\nprint(f\"üìä This demonstrates the knowledge graph system with meaningful entities!\")"
