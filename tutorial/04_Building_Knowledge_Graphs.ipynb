    "- How to extract entities (people, places, things) from text\n",
    "- How to find relationships between entities\n",
    "- How to visualize connections\n",

    "- **Your brain**: Knows that \"Paris\" is connected to \"France\" and \"Eiffel Tower\"\n",
    "- **Knowledge Graph**: Shows these connections visually with lines and dots\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌟 Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Einstein\" ←→ \"developed\" ←→ \"Theory of Relativity\"\n",
    "\"Einstein\" ←→ \"worked at\" ←→ \"Princeton University\"\n",
    "\"Einstein\" ←→ \"born in\" ←→ \"Germany\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Why Knowledge Graphs are Powerful:\n",
    "- **Connections**: See how everything relates\n",
    "- **Discovery**: Find unexpected relationships\n",
    "- **Smart Questions**: \"Who worked with Einstein?\" \n",
    "- **Navigation**: Follow connections to explore topics"
