- **Real applications:** Every tutorial has practical value

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### **Before Starting:**

1. **Activate Environment:**
   ```bash
   source langchain-env/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Start Ollama:**
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

3. **Verify Models:**
   ```bash
   ollama list
   ```
   Should show: `llama3.1:8b` and `nomic-embed-text`

4. **Start Jupyter:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook tutorial/
   ```

### **Tutorial Files:**
- `01_Introduction_to_LLMs_and_Ollama.ipynb` ‚≠ê START
- `02_LangChain_Fundamentals.ipynb`
- `03_Understanding_RAG.ipynb`
- `04_Building_Knowledge_Graphs.ipynb`
- `05_Your_First_Paper_Analysis_System.ipynb` üèÜ FINAL

## üí° Tips for Success

### **Learning Strategy:**
1. **Go step by step** - Don't skip tutorials
2. **Run every code cell** - Learn by doing
3. **Experiment** - Change variables and see what happens
4. **Ask questions** - Each tutorial has examples to try
5. **Take breaks** - Complex concepts need time to sink in

### **If You Get Stuck:**
