Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn 
and make decisions without being explicitly programmed for every task.

There are three main types of machine learning:
1. Supervised Learning: Learning from examples with correct answers
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in data without examples
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through trial and error with rewards

Applications of machine learning include:
- Email spam detection
- Image recognition
- Voice assistants
- Recommendation systems

Machine learning is used in many industries including healthcare, finance, 
transportation, and entertainment.
