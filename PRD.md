## Methods Comparison

Transformer-based approaches to drug discovery have evolved through 
several key architectural innovations. Chen et al. (2023) introduced 
ChemFormer, which combines graph neural networks with self-attention 
mechanisms, achieving 94% accuracy on molecular solubility prediction 
tasks [1]. 

Building on this foundation, Torres et al. (2024) demonstrated that 
simpler neural architectures can achieve comparable performance while 
requiring significantly less computational resources [2]. Their 
comparative analysis across PubChem and ChEMBL datasets revealed...
