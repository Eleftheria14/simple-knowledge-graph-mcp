## What is this?

**GraphRAG MCP Toolkit** transforms your collection of research papers (PDFs) into an intelligent AI assistant. Unlike generic AI that doesn't understand your specific field, this creates a personalized research assistant that:

- **Understands your domain**: Learns the terminology, concepts, and relationships from your papers
- **Chats naturally**: Ask questions like "What are the main themes in transformer research?"
- **Writes literature reviews**: Generate formal academic text with proper citations
- **Tracks citations**: Automatically manages references in APA, IEEE, Nature, and MLA formats
- **Runs locally**: Your data never leaves your computer - complete privacy
- **Integrates with Claude**: Uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to extend Claude Desktop with your research

## Three Ways to Use It

### 1. üñ•Ô∏è Command Line Interface (CLI)
**Perfect for**: Most users, automation, scripting

```bash
# One-command setup
graphrag-mcp quick-setup my-research ./papers/ --auto-serve

# Or step-by-step
graphrag-mcp create my-research --template academic
graphrag-mcp add-documents my-research ./papers/ --recursive
graphrag-mcp process my-research
graphrag-mcp serve my-research --transport stdio
```

üìñ **[Complete CLI Reference ‚Üí](docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md)**

### 2. üêç Python API
**Perfect for**: Developers, custom integrations, notebooks

```python
from graphrag_mcp.api import quick_setup, quick_process

# One-line setup
processor = quick_setup("my-research", "./papers/", template="academic")

# One-line processing
processor = await quick_process("my-research", "./papers/", template="academic")
```

üìñ **[Complete API Reference ‚Üí](docs/API_REFERENCE.md)**

### 3. üîß MCP Tools (for Claude Desktop)
**Perfect for**: Claude Desktop users, AI-assisted research

```python
# Chat tools (conversational)
ask_knowledge_graph("What are the main themes in transformer research?")
explore_topic("attention mechanisms", scope="detailed")

# Literature tools (formal writing)
get_facts_with_citations("transformer architecture", style="APA")
generate_bibliography(style="APA", used_only=True)
```

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/graphrag-mcp-toolkit.git
cd graphrag-mcp-toolkit

# Set up environment (creates Python environment + installs dependencies)
./setup_env.sh
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Ollama (for local AI)
brew install ollama  # Mac
# or download from https://ollama.com for other platforms

# Install Docker (for Neo4j - optional)
# Download from https://docker.com

# Start services
make setup-ollama    # Downloads AI models (~4GB)
make setup-neo4j     # Starts Neo4j container (optional)
```

### Step 3: Process Your Papers

```bash
# Quick setup (easiest way)
graphrag-mcp quick-setup my-research ./papers/ --auto-serve

# This will:
# 1. Create a new project
# 2. Add your PDF files
# 3. Process them into a knowledge graph
# 4. Start the MCP server
```

### Step 4: Connect to Claude Desktop

```bash
# The system auto-generates Claude Desktop configuration
cat claude_desktop_config.json

# Copy this to your Claude Desktop settings
# (~/.config/claude-desktop/config.json)
```

**Then restart Claude Desktop** and look for the üîå icon to confirm connection.

## Real Example

**Before:** You have 30 papers on "machine learning for drug discovery" scattered across your computer. Writing a literature review means manually reading each paper, taking notes, and trying to remember which paper said what.

**After:** You upload all 30 papers to this system. Now you can:

### Chat with Your Research:
- **You:** "What are the main approaches to using transformers in drug discovery?"
- **Claude:** "Based on your papers, there are three main approaches: 1) Molecular property prediction using ChemFormer (Chen et al. 2023), 2) Drug-target interaction modeling with MolTrans (Kumar et al. 2024), and 3) Virtual screening using attention mechanisms (Torres et al. 2023)..."

### Generate Literature Review Text:
- **You:** "Write a paragraph about transformer architectures in drug discovery with citations in APA format"
- **Claude:** "Transformer architectures have emerged as a powerful approach to molecular property prediction. Chen et al. (2023) developed ChemFormer, which combines graph neural networks with transformer attention mechanisms to achieve 94% accuracy on molecular solubility prediction tasks..."

### Track Citations:
- **You:** "Have I used the Chen paper too much in my writing?"
- **Claude:** "You've cited Chen et al. (2023) 8 times across your literature review. This is within acceptable limits for a foundational paper, but you might want to balance with other recent work..."

## How it Works

### The Complete Processing Pipeline:

1. **PDF Ingestion** - Extract text from PDFs using LangChain
2. **Text Processing** - Split into manageable chunks with context preservation
3. **LLM Analysis** - Ollama (llama3.1:8b) extracts entities, relationships, and citations
4. **Content Enhancement** - Text chunks enriched with entity metadata
5. **Context-Aware Embeddings** - nomic-embed-text generates vectors from enhanced chunks
6. **Knowledge Graph Construction** - Graphiti builds real-time knowledge graphs in Neo4j
7. **Citation Storage** - Citations stored in ChromaDB with full context tracking
8. **MCP Server Generation** - FastMCP server provides tools for Claude Desktop

## System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- **CPU**: Modern multi-core processor (Intel i5/AMD Ryzen 5 or better)
- **RAM**: 16GB minimum, 32GB recommended for large collections
- **Storage**: 10GB free space for models and dependencies
- **GPU**: Optional but recommended (NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM or Apple Silicon)

### Software Requirements
- **Operating System**: macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 18.04+, Windows 10+
- **Python**: 3.11 or higher
